# allthingsmen

I look forward to keep this repository updated with all things related to the MEN stack.

if you like the idea of that you can contribute or just give it a star.

this is currently in very early stage so don't expect much. I just started learning MEN and other stuff.

baby steps guys... baby steps. ✌🏽

some stupid things I faced because I'm stupid

I have used yarn 3 here. my mistake I think.
for some reason ES modules are not recognised without the .js extenstion in path.

I've had a hard time trying to make PnP work in yarn and failed.
so I decided to use nodelinker set to nodemodules.

and for some reason I couldn't get the zero-installs on yarn to work either.
I kept getting error 8 when pushing to github until finally cleared git and commited without the .yarn/cache
